# Liver Disease Prediction
This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting liver disease in patients. The project utilizes various classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

The dataset used in this project is the Indian Liver Patient Dataset, which contains various attributes related to liver health, including demographic information and laboratory test results. The goal is to build models that can accurately classify patients as either having liver disease or being healthy based on the given features.

The code includes data preprocessing steps, model training using different algorithms, evaluation of model performance using various metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, as well as visualization of results using seaborn bar plots.

The project aims to provide insights into the prediction of liver disease, which can be valuable for healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Implementation of KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms
- Model evaluation using multiple metrics
- Visualization of evaluation metrics using seaborn bar plots

Please note that this project serves as a learning and demonstration exercise for machine learning techniques and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

Contributions and feedback are welcome!

To run the code in Google Colab, follow these steps:
1-Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.

2-Click on "File" in the top left corner of the Colab interface.

3-Select "Upload notebook" to upload the notebook containing the code or choose "New notebook" to create a new notebook.

4-Once the notebook is open, click on the "+ Code" button to add a code cell.

5-Copy and paste the code into the code cell.

6-If there are any required libraries that are not pre-installed in Colab, you can install them by running the following command in a code cell:
```text
!pip install library_name
```
Replace library_name with the name of the library you want to install.

7-Make sure to upload the dataset file (indian_liver_patient.csv) to your Google Drive. You can upload it by clicking on "Files" on the left sidebar in Colab and selecting "Mount Drive" to connect your Google Drive.

8-Update the file path in the code to point to the correct location of the dataset file in your Google Drive.

9-Run each code cell by clicking on the play button on the left side of the cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.

10-You should see the output and any visualizations generated by the code in the output cells.

Note: Remember to install any required libraries and adjust the file paths as necessary to ensure the code runs smoothly in Colab.
